# 💠 Veth Token — Blockchain Innovation for the Future

Veth Token is a decentralized ERC-20 token project built using Solidity and Foundry.  
It represents a community-driven initiative to explore tokenization, decentralized finance, and blockchain-based ecosystem design.

This project was developed as part of the **TechCrush Capstone Project**, by **Kenneth Biakinogho**, **Jaybaby**, and **Dan** — with a focus on smart contract security, modular testing, and professional DevOps deployment using Foundry.

## 🚀 Overview

Veth Token is an ERC-20 compliant token designed with clarity, transparency, and extendability in mind.  
It follows best practices in Solidity smart contract architecture, integrating OpenZeppelin libraries and tested using Foundry’s Forge framework.

The repository is structured for production-grade Ethereum smart contract development, including:
- A complete ERC-20 contract (`VethToken.sol`)
- A Foundry test suite (`VethToken.t.sol`)
- A deployment script (`VethToken.s.sol`)
- Comprehensive documentation and README

## ⚙️ Features

✅ **ERC-20 Compliant Token** — Implements all standard ERC-20 functions  
✅ **Ownership Management** — Uses OpenZeppelin’s `Ownable` for secure access control  
✅ **Minting and Burning** — Token supply can be adjusted by the owner  
✅ **Customizable Metadata** — Token name, symbol, and supply defined at deployment  
✅ **Secure Testing Environment** — Built and tested with Forge for reliability  
✅ **Gas-Efficient Architecture** — Optimized Solidity 0.8.30 syntax and design
